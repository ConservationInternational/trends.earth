Plugin Builder Results

Your plugin LDMP was created in:
    C:\Users\azvol\Code\VitalSigns\ldmp-qgis-plugin\LDMP

Your QGIS plugin directory is located at:
    C:/Users/azvol/.qgis2/python/plugins

What's Next:

  * Copy the entire directory containing your new plugin to the QGIS plugin
    directory

  * Run the tests (``make test``)

  * Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager

  * Customize it by editing the implementation file: ``land_degradation.py``

  * You can use the Makefile to compile your Ui and resource files when
    you make changes. This requires GNU make (gmake)
