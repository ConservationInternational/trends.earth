The classification presented as Figure 3A.5.1 Classification scheme for default climate regions” (IPCC, 2006) could not be accessed in electronic form and generated from an independently developed set of base data layers. Climatic information on temperature and precipitation was provided by the 5 arc min. dataset Version 1.4 from the WorldClim project (Hijmans et al., 2005). PET was computed according to the temperature-based formula investigated by Oudin et al. (2005) and used by Kay & Davis (2008). The computation of the extraterrestrial radiation was based on Duffie & Beckman (1991) and Allen et al. (1994). The formulas were supplemented by the information provided by the “Solar Radiation Basis” Web-page of the University of Oregon: http://solardat.uoregon.edu/SolarRadiationBasics.html.",

In a series of articles during the early 1980s, Compton J. Tucker, demonstrated how the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) generated from NOAA’s Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data can be used to map land cover and monitor vegetation changes and desertification at continental and global scales. A simple search on the Web of Science reveals over 5000 articles containing NDVI either in the title or in the abstract. Compton J. Tucker continued to generate the NDVI time series over the past 30 years, in the framework of the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System (GIMMS) project, carefully assembling it from different AVHRR sensors and accounting for various deleterious effects, such as calibration loss, orbital drift, volcanic eruptions, etc. The latest version of the GIMMS NDVI data set spans the period July 1981 to December 2011 and is termed NDVI3g (third generation GIMMS NDVI from AVHRR sensors).",

The limited set of NDVI variables is extended by a number of phenological and productivity relevant variables. Keeping statistical solidity, qualitative approaches have been selected to classify, interpret and integrate these several variables. Intermediate products are produced that are then combined into a Land-productivity Dynamics data layer. Land-productivity dynamics can indicate levels of sustained land-quality and is therefore used as first step in the land degradation assessment.",

The careful combination of satellite-based rainfall estimates provides the most complete analysis of rainfall available to date over the global oceans, and adds necessary spatial detail to the rainfall analyses over land. In addition to the combination of these data sets, estimates of the uncertainties in the rainfall analysis are provided as a part of the GPCP products. The August 2012 GPCP v2.2 uses upgraded emission and scattering algorithms, the GPCC precipitation gauge analysis, and inclusion of the DMSP F17 SSMIS. The December 2012 update contains \"recomputed\" October 2012 values. NOTE: Due to a hardware failure, GPCP SG V2.2 and 1DD V1.2 have ceased production. The last processed month is October 2015. The follow-on GPCP V2.3 and 1DD V1.3 will soon become available, reprocessed back to January 1979 and October 1996, respectively. These new versions will be produced by at ESSIC in conjunction with NCEI (formerly NCDC).",
