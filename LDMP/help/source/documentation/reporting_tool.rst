Here there are two options: "Add Basemap" or "Create Print Map". The first allows users to add a Basemap for a first or second level administrative boundary. The second option brings up the Composer window in QGIS to design and export a static map.

By selecting "Add Basemap", the user can select the first or second level administrative boundary. The first level is the country boundary. The second level will be the first sub-division that the country is divided into and will be dependent on the country selected. For example, in the United States of America, the second level will provide a drop down of states. In Kenya, the second level will display provinces.    
Please note the disclaimer in the window. Natural Earth provides the spatial layers contained within the dropdown. These boundaries are not official endorsed by CI or other partner organizations and contributors.
After selecting the dropdown, for the first level and second level if applicable, select "Ok".

After submitting the above message will appear within the QGIS Desktop window. This shows that the Basemap is loading. DO NOT select cancel or attempt another function in QGIS until the Basemap has loaded. The time it takes to load will depend on your Internet connection and computer processor.

If you have a map layer within your QGIS Desktop window, you will now see the Basemap with the administrative level selected clipped out to view the underlying map layer.
If you would like to export to an image or PDF, select the report icon (|iconReporting|). This will open up the "Visualization tools" dialog box:

Enter the title for the map and author(s). Select Portrait or Landscape. Portrait is ideal for boundaries that are longer in height than width, landscape is ideal for boundaries that are longer in width than height.

The Map Composer in QGIS will appear. This allows the user to design a map for export as image (.png or .jpg) or PDF. The user has the ability to change the appearance of the legend and the arrangements of features in the map. The map layer within the QGIS Desktop window will appear within the Composer.
Underneath the Settings menu options, there are several icons to export.
