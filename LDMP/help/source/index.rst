|trends.earth| (formerly the Land Degradation Monitoring Toolbox) is a platform 
for monitoring land change using earth observations in an innovative desktop and cloud-based system.

The three sub-indicators for monitoring achievement of Land Degradation 
Neutrality (LDN, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 15.3), are supported 
by |trends.earth|: productivity, land cover, and soil organic carbon.  The tool 
also supports countries in analyzing data to prepare for their reporting
committments to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification
(UNCCD).

|trends.earth| allows users to plot time series of key indicators of land 
change (including degradation and improvement), to produce maps and other 
graphics that can support monitoring and reporting, and to track the impact of
sustainable land management or other projects.
