about=trends.earth (formerly the Land Degradation Monitoring Toolbox) is a tool for analyzing land change. trends.earth supports monitoring changes in productivity, land cover, and soil organic carbon. The tool can support monitoring land degradation for reporting to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), as well as tracking progress towards achivement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 15.3, Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN).

changelog=1.0.2 (August 5, 2020)
    - Add latest MERRA2 data (through 2019).
    - Remove maximum area limitation from download tool.
    - Bump httplib2 to 0.18.0.
    - Update from GPCC V6 to GPCC V7
    - Add 2019 Hansen et al. deforestation data
    - Update to latest colormap for degradation data (addressing issues with 
      reg/green colorblindness).
    - Add support for more datatypes in input shapefiles (add PointZ, 
      MultiPoint, MultiPointZ, PolygonZ, MultiPolygonZ).
    - Misc bugfixes to address Python errors that were coming up with some 
      QMessageBox messages.
  1.0.0 (April 27, 2020)
, None)    - Add ability to download and use pre-compiled binaries (compiled with 
      Numba) to speed up some local calculations. Right now this only is available 
      for the SDG15.3.1 summary table calculation, but eventually this will be 
      expanded to other tools as well.
    - Related to the above, there is now an "advanced" settings button in the 
      settings window, that will allow users to download pre-compiled binaries, 
      and to turn on or off detailed logging of messages while the tool is 
      running. These log messages can be useful when trying to trouble-shoot 
      problems if you encounter any.
    - Improve checks for geometry validity for geometries in input files, and 
      give an error message rather than throwing an exception when there are 
      geometry errors.
    - Fix processing using new MODIS data (assets were not properly updated in 
      the last release)
    - Fix color-coding of land covers in land cover class aggregation window
    - Add more detailed version information to about dialog.
    - Add additional detail to data download tool.
