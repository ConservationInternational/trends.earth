"The final output should be interpreted as showing areas potentially "

"productivity, land cover and soil organic carbon. Several factor could "
"lead to the identification of patterns of degradation which do not seem "
"to correlate to what is happening on the ground, the date of analysis "
"being a very important one. If the climatic conditions at the beginning "
"of the analysis were particularly wet, for example, trends from that "
"moment on could show significant decreases in primary productivity, and "
"degradation. The user can use Trends.Earth to address some of this issues"
" correcting by the effect of climate. The resolution of the data could "
"potentially be another limitation. Trends.Earth by default uses global "
"datasets which will not be the most relevant at all scales and "
"geographies. A functionality to use local data will be added shortly."

msgid ""
"Vegetation is a key component of most ecosystems, and serve as a good "
"proxy for their overall functioning and health. The three subindicators "
"used for SDG 15.3.1 measure different aspects of land cover, which do "
"relate to vegetation. Primary productivity directly measures the change "
"in amount of biomass present in one area, but it does not inform us if "
"that change is positive or not (not all increases in plant biomass should"
" be interpreted as improvement). Land cover fills that gap by "
"interpreting the landscape from a thematic perspective looking at what "
"was there before and what is there now. It does include vegetation, but "
"also bare land, urban and water. Finally, the soil organic carbon "
"indicator uses the land cover map to inform the changes in soil organic "
"carbon over time. This method is not ideal, but given the current state "
"of global soil science and surveying, there is consensus that it this "
"point in time and globally, this is the best approach."
