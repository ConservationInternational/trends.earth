"Vegetation is a key component of most ecosystems, and serve as a good "

"used for SDG 15.3.1 measure different aspects of land cover, which do "
"relate to vegetation. Primary productivity directly measures the change "
"in amount of biomass present in one area, but it does not inform us if "
"that change is positive or not (not all increases in plant biomass should"
" be interpreted as improvement). Land cover fills that gap by "
"interpreting the landscape from a thematic perspective looking at what "
"was there before and what is there now. It does include vegetation, but "
"also bare land, urban and water. Finally, the soil organic carbon "
"indicator uses the land cover map to inform the changes in soil organic "
"carbon over time. This method is not ideal, but given the current state "
"of global soil science and surveying, there is consensus that it this "
"point in time and globally, this is the best approach."
