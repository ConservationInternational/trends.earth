"Trends.Earth is a platform to monitor land change using earth "
"observations. It is now available as a browser-based tool in addition to "
"the plugin to desktop QGIS spatial-analytical software."

"The tool allows users to assess time series of key indicators of land "
"change to produce maps and other graphics that can support monitoring and"
" reporting, and to track the impact of sustainable land management. The "
"tool supports monitoring progress on land degradation neutrality (SDG "
"15.3.1), land consumption (SDG 11.3.1), modeling carbon emissions from "
"deforestation, and modeling potential carbon sequestration from "
"restoration activities. Trends.Earth supports monitoring and reporting on"
" Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 15.3.1 (area of degraded land) and "
"11.3.1 (ration of land consumption rate to population growth) by "
"providing a platform for analyzing data for reporting commitments to the "
"United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and UN-"
"Habitat."

"The three sub-indicators for monitoring achievement of Land Degradation "
"Neutrality (LDN, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 15.3), are "
"supported by |trends.earth|: productivity, land cover, and soil organic "
"carbon.  The tool also supports countries in analyzing data to prepare "
"for their reporting commitments to the United Nations Convention to "
"Combat Desertification (UNCCD)."
