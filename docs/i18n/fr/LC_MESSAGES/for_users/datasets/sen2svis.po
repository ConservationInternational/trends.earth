"Global geospatial datasets representing annual integral land productivity at"
" 10-m spatial resolution for 2018 to 2021 with minimal observation gaps. A "
"harmonic model is applied to vegetation indices derived from Sentinel 2 "
"MultiSpectral Instrument A & B imagery to minimize the impact of missing "
"good quality pixels mainly due to cloud coverage. Remote Sensing vegetation "
"indices have been widely used as proxy for land productivity and to monitor "
"vegetation condition, given they rely on the well-known biophysical "
"interactions between photosynthesis and narrow bands of the electromagnetic "
"spectrum. The Trends.Earth 10-m global land productivity are produced based "
"on three vegetation indices: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices – "
"NDVI, the 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index- EVI2, and the Modified Soil "
"Adjusted Vegetation Index – MSAVI."
