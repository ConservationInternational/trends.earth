msgid "Human settlements, in all their diverse forms, appropriate land in varied ways. Just like living organisms, urban settlements (cities) evolve, transform, adapt, innovate and change with emerging trends. Urban settlements expand, shrink, densify, intensify, age, and sometimes their functions even migrate to areas that are more conducive to their survival. All these trends in urban settlements are closely associated with such factors as changes in population, economic potential and productivity, prevailing physical and social conditions, presence of enabling policies, among other things."

msgid "A country that maximizes the many benefits associated with urbanization is one that is able to understand, measure and predict the growth trends of its urban areas; and in turn put in place the necessary actions/interventions to tap on the benefits of such growth, while minimizing the equally diverse challenges associated with unplanned urbanization. Pro-active planning - which is a major pre-requisite for sustainable urbanization - requires that city authorities and other relevant actors predict the direction of growth of a city, and/or shape this growth by providing the required facilities, services and policy and legal frameworks ahead of development. This results in planned and equitable growth in which majority of the city residents have access to the basic services, economic and social opportunities, and where environmental sustainability prevails. At the centre of all these is the need for generation and dissemination of up-to-date and accurate data on growth trends across cities and urban settlements."

To monitor progress towards the achievement of target 11.3 the UN established indicator 11.3.1, which measures how efficiently cities utilize land, which is measured as a ratio of the rate at which cities spatially consume land against the rate at which their populations grow. **Empirical evidence has shown that, cities that are compact use land more efficiently and are better placed to provide public goods and basic services at a lower cost**. Such cities can consume less energy, manage waste better, and are more likely to maximize the benefits associated with economics of agglomeration. On the other hand, sprawling cities (non-compact cities) experience increased demand for mobility; increased energy consumption; environmental degradation; increased cost of providing basic services per capita (e.g. water, sanitation, drainage); increased cost of infrastructure per capita; reduction in economies of agglomeration; and decreased urban productivity."

This is needed to provide adequate infrastructure, services and amenities for the improvement of living conditions to all. Generation and dissemination of data on this indicator is thus not only crucial for understanding urban growth dynamics and formulation of informed policies and guidelines, but is also at the core of promoting sustainable urbanization."

The lack of a time series of night time lights of consistently calibrated for the time period considered (2000-2015), means that we can't mask year with its corresponding year, so we use VIIRS Nighttime Day/Night Band Composites Version 1 for the year 2015 (NOA, 2019).

By adjusting the water frequency threshold, the user can choose to highlight these land-water dynamic areas. Setting the water frequency threshold value lower will mean that your final built-up area dataset will consider as covered by water areas with lower water frequencies throughout the time series, such as intermittent rivers or lakes. Setting this value higher will restrict water bodies to areas with a high frequency of water occurrence (i.e. permanent rivers and lakes)."

Attributes such as presence of habitable areas (land use classes) can be used to distribute the population, such that grid cells in tracks of undeveloped land or in industrial areas will have less population than high density residential areas. In the resulting grid, each grid cell will have a unique value, which is dependent on factors such as the total population within the enclosing administrative/census unit, and the number and/or quantity of the habitable land use classes. Figure 5 illustrates the general logic of population grids using only one land use class – the built-up areas. The population grid should always cover an area larger than the defined urban boundaries. Once the population grids are created, estimation of the population living within the urban boundaries can then be achieved by aggregating populations of the enclosed grid cells. In the absence of high-resolution data from NSOs, this option produces better estimates for population, although high quality input data and multi-level analysis are essential for enhanced data accuracy. Global datasets representing populations at 1km² and 250m grids are available (e.gs GPWv4, GHS-POP, WorldPop); most of which assume equal distribution of population to the habitable classes (e.g built up areas).
