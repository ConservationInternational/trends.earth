"The UNCCD SO3 Level III drought Exposure indicator is built upon the SO 3"
" Level I Hazard indicator by overlaying a gridded population data. Using "
"the overlaying population as a proxy for calculating drought exposure is "
"a straight-forward method. Knowing how many people are directly affected "
"by drought can help aid get allocated to the most needed areas, based on "
"percent of population exposed and strength of that exposure (drought "
"severity). This method can also serve as a proxy for socioeconomic "
"drought.The gender disaggregation calculation for the SO3 Level II "
"population indicator is computed based on percent male and percent female"
" in each grid cell. The outputs include exposure information by gender "
"(percent male and percent female) exposed to each Level I drought "
"intensity class. This produces two comparable grids that could be "
"aggregated to administrative boundaries if desired, where global and "
"local spatial relationships between gender and drought occurrence and/or "
"severity can be better quantified and visualized."

"The WorldPop collection is a global gridded high resolution geospatial "

"WorldPop's spatially disaggregated layers are gridded with an output "
"resolution of 3 arc-seconds and 30 arc-seconds (approximately 100 m & 1 "
"km, respectively at the equator) and incorporates inputs such as "
"population census tables & national geographic boundaries, roads, land "
"cover, built structures, urban areas, night-time lights, infrastructure, "
"environmental data, protected areas, and water bodies. The strengths of "
"WorldPop are that the population estimation method of dasymetric mapping "
"is multivariate, i.e., highly modeled, and therefore tailored to match "
"data conditions and geographical nature of each individual country and "
"region. Gender information is also available. The weakness of WorldPop is"
" that the utilization of such complex interpolation models with sparse "
"census data may lead to highly uncertain and imprecise population "
"estimates in some sub-national and rural regions. In spite of the "
"aforementioned limitation, WorldPop remains the most ideal gridded "
"population dataset as it satisfies all our inclusion criteria, including "
"spatial resolution, global coverage, frequency of data updates, and "
"inclusion of a gender-disaggregated component."
