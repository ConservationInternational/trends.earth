"The UNCCD SO3 Level III drought Exposure indicator is built upon the SO 3 "
"Level I Hazard indicator by overlaying a gridded population data. Using the "
"overlaying population as a proxy for calculating drought exposure is a "
"straight-forward method. Knowing how many people are directly affected by "
"drought can help aid get allocated to the most needed areas, based on "
"percent of population exposed and strength of that exposure (drought "
"severity). This method can also serve as a proxy for socioeconomic "
"drought.The gender disaggregation calculation for the SO3 Level II "
"population indicator is computed based on percent male and percent female in"
" each grid cell. The outputs include exposure information by gender (percent"
" male and percent female) exposed to each Level I drought intensity class. "
"This produces two comparable grids that could be aggregated to "
"administrative boundaries if desired, where global and local spatial "
"relationships between gender and drought occurrence and/or severity can be "
"better quantified and visualized."

"the equator) and incorporates inputs such as population census tables & "

"nature of each individual country and region. Gender information is also "
"available. The weakness of WorldPop is that the utilization of such complex "
"interpolation models with sparse census data may lead to highly uncertain "
"and imprecise population estimates in some sub-national and rural regions. "
"In spite of the aforementioned limitation, WorldPop remains the most ideal "
