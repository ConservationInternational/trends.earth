"The first step before analyzing urban change is to define the extent of "

"<https://geflanddegradation.users.earthengine.app/view/trendsearth-urban-"
"mapper>`_. This step is fundamental to make sure that the built up area "
"identified by the indicators accurately reflects the conditions in your area"
" of study. The `Trends.Earth Urban Mapper "
"<https://geflanddegradation.users.earthengine.app/view/trendsearth-urban-"
"mapper>`_ allows users to explore how changing different parameters impact "
"the extent of the built up area data which will be then used to define "
