"When the raster file is too big, due to a large study area, high spatial "
"resolution, or a large number of bands in the file, the data could take "
"several seconds to display. If you change the zoom or turn layers on an  "
"off frequently, this could make the work a bit frustrating. An option to "
"overcome this is to compute **Pyramids** to the file. This process will "
"take from **minutes to hours** to run depending on the size of the area, "
"so make sure to have enough time for it to process. To compute pyramids "
"you have to:"

"When using the **Calculate all three sub-indicators in one step** option "
"(described in the tutorial :ref:`tut_land_degradation`), all the bands "
"are stored in a single TIF file, so even though you see three layers "
"loaded in the QGIS window, they all refer to the same file. This means "
"that the pyramids need to be computed only once for the three sub-"
"indicators."

"To the right of the window you will see the **Resolutions** options. "
"Selecting all of them will make displaying in QGIS the fastest, but this "
"could take hours to compute depending on the file size and processing "
"capabilities of the computer you are using. For the Uganda example, we "
"can select them all, but if using a larger area or higher spatial "
"resolution than the default 250m, we recommend you select alternating "
"resolutions options (i.e. one resolution selected and one not selected, "
"and so on). Resolutions are selected by clicking on them. When selected, "
"they will turn blue."
