"Basemaps are very useful as a reference for identifying specific "
"locations in maps. When downloaded, Trends.Earth results are displayed on"
" an empty QGIS project, which could limit the user ability for "
"identifying know places in the landscape. To facilitate this process, you"
" can use the **Add Basemap** tool which will load country and state "
"boundaries, roads, rivers, cities, coastlines and water bodies with "
"labels to the QGIS project."

"option is useful when displaying the sub-indicators downloaded from "
"Trends.Earth, since the data download is not clipped to administrative "
"boundaries (a bounding box is used instead). You can use first and second"
" level administrative boundaries."
