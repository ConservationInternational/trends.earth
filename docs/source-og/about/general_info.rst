The feedback provided by early users of |trends.earth| and by the participants
in the webinars and workshops held by the GEF Land Degradation Monitoring
Project have been critical to the development of the tool.

Neil Sims, Sasha Alexander, Renato Cumani, and Sara Minelli provided input on
the implementation of the SDG 15.3 and LDN indicators in |trends.earth|, on the
structure of the tool, and on the UNCCD reporting process, and also provided
early input and testing of the tool.

The project acknowledges the participants of the workshop held in Morogoro,
Tanzania in October, 2017 for sharing their feedback and suggestions on the
tool: Jones Agwata, Col. Papa Assane Ndiour, Lt. Fendama Baldé, Papa Nékhou
