The feedback provided by early users of |trends.earth| and by the participants 
in the webinars and workshops held by the GEF Land Degradation Monitoring 
Project have been critical to the development of the tool.

Neil Sims, Sasha Alexander, Renato Cumani, and Sara Minelli provided input on 
the implementation of the SDG 15.3 and LDN indicators in |trends.earth|, on the 
structure of the tool, and on the UNCCD reporting process, and also provided 
early input and testing of the tool.
