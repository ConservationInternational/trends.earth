Sustainable Development Goal 15.3 intends to combat desertification, restore 
degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and 
floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world by 2030. In 
order to assess the progress to this goal, the agreed-upon indicator for SDG 
15.3 (proportion of land area degraded) is a combination of three 
sub-indicators: change in land productivity, change in land cover and change  
in soil organic carbon.

To select the methods and datasets to calculate these indicators, indicators 
click on the calculator icon (|iconCalculator|). This will open up the 
"Calculate Indicators" dialog box.

There are several options for calculating the SDG 15.3.1 Indicator. 
|trends.earth| supports calculating the indicator using the same process as was 
used by the UNCCD for the default data provided to countries for the 2018 
reporting process. The tool also supports customizing this data, or even 
replacing individual datasets with national-level or other global datasets.

- To calculate all three SDG 15.3.1 indicators in one step, using default 
  settings for most of the indicators, click "Calculate all three indicators in 
  one step".

- To calculate one of the three SDG 15.3.1 indicators, using customized 
  settings, or national-level data, click "Productivity", "Land cover", or 
  "Soil organic carbon".

- To calculate a summary table showing statistics on each of the three 
  indicators, click "Calculate final SDG 15.3.1 indicator and summary table". 
  Note that you must first compute the indicators using one of the above 
  options.
  
- To calculate a summary table showing statistics on each of the three 
  indicators for multiple sub-divisions, click "Calculate area summaries of a raster on sub-units". 
  Note that you must first compute the indicators using one of the above 
  options.

There are three different indicators that are combined to create the SDG 15.3.1 
indicator

- Productivity: measures the trajectory, performance and state of primary 
  productivity

- Land cover: calculates land cover change relative to a baseline period, enter 
  a transition matrix indicating which transitions indicate degradation, 
  stability or improvement.

- Soil carbon: compute changes in soil organic carbon as a consequence of 
  changes in land cover.

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`indicator-15-3-1` section of this manual for a detailed 
    explanation of how each of these sub-indicators is computed in 
    |trends.earth|

There are two ways to calculate the indicators: 1) using a simplified tool that 
will calculate all three indicators at once, but with limited options for 
customization, or 2) using individual tools for each indicator that offer 
complete control over how they are calculated.

Calculate productivity
______________________

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`indicator-productivity` background information in this 
    manual for a detailed explanation of how productivity is computed.

Productivity measures the trajectory, performance and state of primary 
productivity using either 8km AVHRR or 250m MODIS datasets. The user can select 
one or multiple indicators to calculate, the NDVI dataset, name the tasks and 
enter in explanatory notes for their intended reporting area.

Productivity Trajectory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trajectory assesses the rate of change of productivity over time. To calculate 
trajectory:

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`indicator-productivity-trajectory` section in this 
    manual for a detailed explanation of this indicator is computed.

1) Select an indicator to calculate

2) Select NDVI dataset to use and select Next

.. note::
    The valid date range is set by the NDVI dataset selected within the first 
    tab: AVHRR dates compare 1982-2015 and MODIS 2001-2016.

.. image:: /static/documentation/calculate/image029.png
   :align: center

3) In the tab "Advanced", select the method to be used to compute the 
   productivity trajectory analysis. The options are:

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`indicator-productivity-climate-correction` information 
    in this manual for a more detailed explanation of each of these 
    calculations.

* **NDVI trend**: This dataset shows the trend in annually integrated NDVI time 
  series (2001-2015) using MODIS (250m) dataset (MOD13Q1) or AVHRR (8km; 
  GIMMS3g.v1). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is the ratio 
  of the difference between near-infrared band (NIR) and the red band (RED) and 
  the sum of these two bands (Rouse et al., 1974; Deering 1978) and reviewed in 
  Tucker (1979). 


* **RUE**: is defined as the ratio between net primary production (NPP), in 
  this case annual integrals of NDVI, and rainfall. It has been increasingly 
  used to analyze the variability of vegetation production in arid and 
  semi-arid biomes, where rainfall is a major limiting factor for plant growth


* **RESTREND**: this method attempts to adjust the NDVI signals from the effect 
  of particular climatic drivers, such as rainfall or soil moisture, using a 
  pixel-by-pixel linear regression on the NDVI time series and the climate 
  signal. The linear model and the climatic data is used then to predict NDVI, 
  and to compute the residuals between the observed and climate-predicted NDVI 
  annual integrals. The NDVI residual trend is finally plotted to spatially 
  represent overall trends in primary productivity independent of climate. 

* **WUE**: is defined as the ratio between net primary production (NPP), in 
  this case annual integrals of NDVI, and evapotranspiration.

Productivity Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Performance is a comparison of how productivity in an area compares to 
productivity in similar areas at the same point in time. To calculate 
performance:

1) Select the start and end year of the period of analysis  for comparison. 

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`indicator-productivity-performance` section in this 
    manual for a detailed explanation of this indicator is computed.

Productivity State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
State performs a comparison of how current productivity in an area compares to 
past productivity. To calculate state:

1) Define the baseline and comparison periods for the computation of the State 
   sub-indicator.

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`indicator-productivity-state` section in this manual for 
    a detailed explanation of this indicator is computed.

The next step is to define the study area on which to perform the analysis. The 
tool allows selecting the area of interest in one of two ways:

1. Selects first (i.e. country) and/or second (i.e. province or state) 
   administrative boundary from a drop-down menu. 

2. The user can provide a shapefile, KML, or geojson defining an area of 
   interest. Once this is done, Select Next.

3. The next step is to write a Task name and some notes to indicate which 
   options were selected for the analysis.

.. image:: /static/documentation/calculate/image032.png
   :align: center
   
4. When all the parameters have been defined, click "Calculate", and the task 
   will be submitted to Google Earth Engine for computing. When the task is 
   completed (processing time will vary depending on server usage, but for most 
   countries it takes only a few minutes most of the time), you’ll receive an 
   email notifying the successful completion.

5. When the Google Earth Engine task has completed and you received the email, 
   click "Refresh List" and the status will show FINISHED. Click on the task 
   and select "Download results" at the bottom of the window. A pop up window 
   will open for you to select where to save the layer and to assign it a name. 
   Then click "Save". The layer will be saved on your computer and 
   automatically loaded into yoour current QGIS project.

Calculate land cover
____________________

Changes in land cover is one of the indicators used to track potential land 
degradation which need to be reported to the UNCCD and to track progress 
towards SDG 15.3.1. While some land cover transitions indicate, in most cases, 
processes of land degradation, the interpretation of those transitions are for 
the most part context specific. For that reason, this indicator requires the 
input of the user to identify which changes in land cover will be considered as 
degradation, improvement or no change in terms of degradation. The toolbox 
allows users to calculate land cover change relative to a baseline period, 
enter a transition matrix indicating which transitions indicate degradation, 
stability or improvement.

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`indicator-land-cover` background information in this 
    manual for a detailed explanation of how land cover change is computed.

To calculate the land cover change indicator:

1. Click on the Calculate Indicators button from the toolbox bar, then select 
   Land cover.
   
.. image:: /static/documentation/calculate/image033.png
   :align: center

2. Within the "Land Cover Setup tab" the user selects the baseline and target years

.. image:: /static/documentation/calculate/image034.png
   :align: center
   
3. The land cover aggregation can be customized using the 'Edit definition' 
   button. The user can define their own aggregation of land cover classes from 
   the 37 ESA land cover classes to the 7 UNCCD categories.

   A. Select the dial button for the "Custom" option and select "Create new 
      definition" 

   B. Edit the aggregation suitable for the area of interest

   C. Select "Save definition" and select Next

.. image:: /static/documentation/calculate/image035.png
   :align: center
   
4. Within the "Define Degradation tab" user define the meaning of each land 
   cover transition in terms of degradation. The options are: stable (0), 
   degradation (-) or improvement (+). For example, the default for cropland to 
   cropland is 0 because the land cover stays the same and is therefore stable. 
   The default for forest to cropland is -1 because forest is likely cut to 
   clear way for agriculture and would be considered deforestation. The user is 
   encouraged to thoroughly evaluate the meaning of each transition based on 
   their knowledge of the study area, since this matrix will have an important 
   effect on the land degradation identified by this subindicator.

   Users can keep the default values or create unique transition values of 
   their own.

5. The next step is to define the study area on which to perform the analysis. 
   The toolbox allows this task to be completed in one of two ways:

   A. The user selects first (i.e. country) and second (i.e. province or state) 
      administrative boundary from a drop-down menu.

   B. The user can upload a shapefile with an area of interest.

_____________________

Soil Organic Carbon is calculated as a proxy for carbon stocks. It is measured 
using soil data and changes in land cover.

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`indicator-soc` background information in this manual for 
    a detailed explanation of how soil organic carbon change is computed.
