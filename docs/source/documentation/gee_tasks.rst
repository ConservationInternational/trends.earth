Once you have submitted a calculation using |trends.earth|, it is sent to Google Earth Engine to run the calculations in the cloud. To view the Google Earth Engine (GEE) tasks you have running, and to download your results, select the "Datasets" tab from the Trends.Earth panel. 

The Datasets tab shows all the tasks you have submitted and their status. The Dataset tab shows the task name provided by the user, the start time when the task was started and whether or not the task was successful. Users can view their current and previous tasks here. The user can also: 

1. Load a dataset onto the QGIS map area. |iconLoaddataset|
2. View a dataset's details. |iconViewdatasetdetails|
3. Open the directory where a dataset is stored. |iconOpendatasetdirectory|
4. Delete a dataset. |iconDeletedataset|

The Dataset Details page outlines the different options the user chose for each task.

To automatically download remotely generated datasets (results) to the computer, see :ref:`registration`.    

To manually download results to the computer once a task has finished, click on the task you are interested in downloading results for, then click the Download results icon |iconCloudDownload|. The download will be saved in the base data directory (see :ref:`registration`).

Note that some downloads might consist of multiple files - all of these files need to be kept together if the results are moved to a different location on 
the computer (or saved to a USB stick).
