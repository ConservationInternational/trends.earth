# Trends.Earth Global Land Productivity datasets at 10-m spatial resolution

Global geospatial datasets representing annual integral land productivity at 10-m
spatial resolution for 2018 to 2021 with minimal observation gaps. A harmonic model is
applied to vegetation indices derived from Sentinel 2 MultiSpectral Instrument A & B
imagery to minimize the impact of missing good quality pixels mainly due to cloud
coverage. Remote Sensing vegetation indices have been widely used as proxy for land
productivity and to monitor vegetation condition, given they rely on the well-known
biophysical interactions between photosynthesis and narrow bands of the electromagnetic
spectrum. The Trends.Earth 10-m global land productivity are produced based on three
vegetation indices: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices – NDVI, the 2-band
Enhanced Vegetation Index- EVI2, and the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index –
MSAVI.

The Trends.Earth land productivity datasets at 10-m spatial resolution cover virtually
all land pixels from 180° East to 180° West and 80° North to 80° South excluding
Antarctica and are available at annual steps from 2018 to 2021. Theoretically, pixel
values are as follows:

| VI   | Maximum value | Minimum value |
| ---- | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| EVI2 |     1.25      |     -0.7      |
| EVI2 |      1.5      |     -0.5      |
| NDVI |       1       |      -1       |

However, please note that in real life actual values are greater than 0, excepts for
exceptionally dark pixels, such those covering water bodies.
