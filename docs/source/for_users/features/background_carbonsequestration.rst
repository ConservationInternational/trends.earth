Potential carbon sequestration from restoration
================================================

Background
------------

Restoration could remove 400 Gt of CO2 by 2100 (Griscom et. al., 2017), putting us on the pathway to reduce
carbon emissions to keep us within the Paris Climate Agreement goal to limit “the increase in the global average 
temperature to well below 2 °C above preindustrial levels” (UNFCCC 2015). Forest landscape restoration is a natural climate 
solution for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through different reforestation efforts.

Rationale for Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a need for tools to support restoration prioritization, and planning restoration activities on the ground. 
This module in Trends.Earth allows users to estimate the potential climate benefits of different forest landscape
restoration approaches.

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`tut_carbon_sequestration_restoration` for the tutorial to use this methodology and data.

Indicator and data needs
--------------------------

This module allows users to select a restoration type (terrestrial or mangrove) within a region and length of restoration activity to estimate change in biomass (CO2 equivalence)
for 8 different restoration activities.

The years of intervention and region is then selected using the pre-existing national/subnational boundaries, a coordinate or a custom uploaded dataset.

.. note::
    The `Natural Earth Administrative Boundaries`_ provided in Trends.Earth 
    are in the `public domain`_. The boundaries and names used, and the 
    designations used, in Trends.Earth do not imply official endorsement or 
    acceptance by Conservation International Foundation, or by its partner 
    organizations and contributors.

    If using Trends.Earth for official purposes, it is recommended that users 
    choose an official boundary provided by the designated office of their 
    country.

Trends.Earth gives the change in biomass under the 8 scenarios and a tabular output with the 
change in biomass compared to pre-restoration levels and final total biomass in tons CO2 equivalence.
