Before installing the toolbox
==============================

Before installing the toolbox, QGIS version |qgisMinVersion| or higher
needs to be installed on your computer.

Download QGIS
-------------

To install the plugin, first install QGIS 3.10.3+ following the below steps:


1. Choose either 32 or 64 bit version

   You have the option of installing a 32-bit or 64-bit version of QGIS. To 
   know which version to install, check which type of operating system you have 
   following the below instructions. If you are unsure which you need, try 
   downloading the 64 bit version first. If that version doesn't work properly, 
   un-install it and then install the 32 bit version.

   * Windows 8 or Windows 10

     + From the "Start" screen, type "This PC".

     + Right click (or tap and hold) "This PC", and click "Properties".

   * Windows 7, or Vista

     + Open "System" by clicking the "Start" button , right-clicking 
       "Computer", and then clicking "Properties".

     + Under System, you can view the system type.

   * Mac: Click the Apple icon in the top left and select "About this Mac".

2. After determining whether you need the 32 or 64 bit version, download the 
   appropriate installer:

   * Windows: `Download Windows installer from here 
     <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html#windows>`_.

   * MacOS: `Download MacOS installer from here 
     <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html#mac>`_.

   * Linux: `Download Linux installer from here, or from the repository for 
     your Linux distribution 
     <https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html#linux>`_.

Install QGIS
------------

Once the installer is downloaded from the website, it needs to be run (double 
click on it). Select the Default settings for all options.


Installing older versions of QGIS
---------------------------------

Older versions of QGIS can be accessed at the below links. We recommend the 
latest version of QGIS (see instructions above) but the below links might be 
useful if you have a specific need for accessing an older version of the 
Trends.Earth plugin (for example the QGIS2 version of the plugin).

* Windows: `Download older versions of QGIS for Windows here
  <https://qgis.org/downloads/>`_.

* MacOS: `Download older versions of QGIS for MacOS here 
  <https://qgis.org/downloads/macOS>`_.
