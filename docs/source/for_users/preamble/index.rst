Preamble
===================
Trends.Earth is a platform to monitor land change using earth observations. It is now available 
as a browser-based tool in addition to the plugin to desktop QGIS spatial-analytical 
software.

The tool allows users to assess time series of key indicators of land change to produce maps and 
other graphics that can support monitoring and reporting, and to track the impact of sustainable 
land management. The tool supports monitoring progress on land degradation neutrality (SDG 15.3.1), 
land consumption (SDG 11.3.1), modeling carbon emissions from deforestation, and modeling potential 
carbon sequestration from restoration activities. Trends.Earth supports monitoring and reporting on 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 15.3.1 (area of degraded land) and 11.3.1 (ration of land 
consumption rate to population growth) by providing a platform for analyzing data for reporting 
commitments to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and UN-Habitat. 

The development of Trends.Earth was funded by the Global Environment Facility and NASA, 
led by Conservation International and its partners. `Conservation International`_  
works to spotlight and secure the critical benefits that nature provides to humanity. 

**Monitor land change**

Trends.Earth (formerly the Land Degradation Monitoring Toolbox) is a platform
from `Conservation International`_ for monitoring land change using earth observations
in an innovative desktop and cloud-based system.

**Track achievement of the sustainable development goals**

The three sub-indicators for monitoring achievement of Land Degradation
Neutrality (LDN, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Target 15.3), are supported
by |trends.earth|: productivity, land cover, and soil organic carbon.  The tool
also supports countries in analyzing data to prepare for their reporting
commitments to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification
(UNCCD).

Trends.Earth allows users to plot time series of key indicators of land change
(including degradation and improvement), to produce maps and other graphics
that can support monitoring and reporting, and to track the impact of
sustainable land management or other projects.
