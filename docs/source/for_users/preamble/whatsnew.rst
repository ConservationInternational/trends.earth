Preamble
===================
Trends.Earth is a tool to monitor trends on land condition. It is now available 
as a browser-based tool in addition to the plugin to desktop QGIS spatial-analytical 
software.

The tool allows users to plot time series of key indicators of land change to produce 
maps and other graphics that can support monitoring and reporting, and to track the 
impact of sustainable land management for other projects. There are four modules to 
monitor progress on land degradation neutrality (SDG 15.3.1), land consumption (SDG 11.3.1), 
and model carbon emissions from deforestation and carbon sequestration under restoration 
activities. Trends.Earth supports monitoring and reporting on Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) 15.3.1 (area of degraded land) and 11.3.1 (ration of land consumption rate to 
population growth) by providing a platform for analyzing data for reporting commitments 
to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and UN-Habitat. 

The development of Trends.Earth is funded by the Global Environment Facility and NASA, 
led by Conservation International and its partners. `Conservation International <https://www.conservation.org/>`_  
works to spotlight and secure the critical benefits that nature provides to humanity.
